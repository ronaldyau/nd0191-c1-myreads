# An updated README that describes the project and has instructions for installing and launching the project is included.

# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. Interactivity to the app was added by refactoring the static code originally in the template.

## Setup
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

[`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend:

- [`getAll`](#getall)
- [`update`](#update)
- [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll();
```

- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
- This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf);
```

- book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
- shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query);
```

- query: `<String>`
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
- These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.
